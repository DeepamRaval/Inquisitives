Domain 3: Cybersecurity & Privacy
Project Title: Safe-Scan Lite – QR Code Safety & Risk Explanation Tool
1. Background
QR codes are convenient but pose a security risk known as "Quishing" (QR Phishing), where
malicious codes redirect users to unsafe sites. Non-technical users often cannot distinguish
between safe and malicious QR codes.
2. The Challenge
Build a user-friendly security tool that scans/uploads a QR code, decodes it safely, analyzes the
embedded URL, and explains the potential risks to the user in simple terms.
3. Expected Deliverables
●
●
●
Functional web or mobile tool.
Demonstration of risk detection logic.
Source code repository with documentation.
●
Determine attack vector.
